**Talk To Me** is a mental health web app designed to provide a unique, gentle, AI-powered therapeutic support. 
In contrast to normal AI therapists, Talk To Me provides a wide array of therapy techniques:
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Somatic Therapy, Psychodynamic Therapy; so that everyone can have the
support which best suits them! Users can chat with one of three virtual therapists, each representing 
a different approach to healing. Sessions are powered by the **Gemini API** and saved locally through cookies for
